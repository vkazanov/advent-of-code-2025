* Day 1

A simple intruction-following problem. The only trick - using mod.

* Day 2

Again, a relative simple brute-force problem pair. Mostly knowledge of python trivia
checked.

* Day 3

A problem where I was tempted to use some kind of random subset choice, or even dynamic
programming or something. But then realized that it's always possible to pick the best
option from existing ones.

* Day 4

A simple 2D map counting problem. Most of the code is walking the map.

Also an interesting set-based approach tried in Part2: compact but slow.
